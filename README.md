# Voice Assistant
## Introduction
The project aims to run as a script in the background while the user is able to ask for task with simple voice commands. <br>
The commands will incorporate various python libraries for automation with major emphasis on ```pyautogui```, ```keyboard``` and more. <br>

## Scope
As of now the assistant will activate upon listening to a specific keyword, and then act on some pre regsitered instructions.<br>
The user can add their own instructions with their voice by anothen keyword ```"instruction save"```.<br>
Aim to incorporate **Artificial Intelligence** to identify the command to be executed without being in the exact format. <br>

## Progress
The model as of now is able to take any file input and extract audio using ```Whisper-Turbo-v3```. <br>
